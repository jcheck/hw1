    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      With the recent passing of David Bowie, as pictured above in his last known photo, I thought it fitting to create my first assignment in his honor.
      Born David Robert Jones in South London in 1947, David Bowie, was an English born musician, who at an early age excelled at playing the recorder and later the saxophone.  David quickly developed an affinity for music and began his music career at the ripe age of 15.  From here forward, David Bowie's innovative and unique style quickly propelled him to new heights, ultimately growing his name into an international household name.  David Bowie's influence reaches far beyond the scope of music and he is credited with inspiring creativity and innovation in modern pop culture.
